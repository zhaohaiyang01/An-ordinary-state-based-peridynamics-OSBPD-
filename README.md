# An-ordinary-state-based-peridynamics-OSBPD-
This program is about An-ordinary-state-based-peridynamics(OSBPD).

Many codes is rewritten from Fortran codes("Peridynamic Theory and Its Applications") and Matlab codes (written by @lazyzq “MatlabPeridynamicsCode”).

This simple code is perfect for beginners in the field of peridynamics.

This code sovle a 2D plate subjected to a tensile load by OSBPD. 3D problem can be easily simulated after minor modifications.

The volume method is used to surface correction.

But here there is a fatal problem: very low computational efficiency. If you have any suggestions, please tell me. 

Last I hope this code can help you learn PD better, and if you have any questions about Pd, you can discuss them with me by my researchgate:
